To compile this as win64 executable for Windows, just use GCC compiler:
   >gcc -o clop.exe clop.c

But in win32, x86 you can see this: https://www.computerhope.com/issues/pictures/not-a-valid-win32-application.jpg

So to do compilation clop.c as win32 executable - just use "-m32" key:
   >gcc -m32 -o clop.exe clop.c

Also, I see this program have name a clop. "Клоп" in russian sounds disgustingly like a "bug", "crum".
But programming language of this is C.
So I think "cyclop" will be good name for this program...

	- Cyclop multi-icon ico-file - added.

	To add icon when compile - just follow this manual: https://fragglet.livejournal.com/4448.html
	This page on livejournal not opening correctly sometimes, so I'll write instructions here:
      Step 1. Need to create .rc file with contents:
         'MAINICON ICON "cyclop.ico"'
         or
         '1 ICON "cyclop.ico"'
         (one string without right whitespaces and without left and right single quotes).
      Step 2. Create .o file using windress. See -h, set -F. For win32 (x32) format must be pei-i38
         >windres -F pei-i38 6 cyclop.rc cyclop.o
      Step 3. After creating .o file - just compile .c-file with .o file - using gcc:
         >gcc -m32 clop.c cyclop.o -o cyclop_win32.exe
      ____________________________________________________________________________
      for win64, linux, etc. Maybe need to set another formats (-F) in windres when creating -o file. See "windress -h".
