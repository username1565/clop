To compile this as win64 executable for Windows, just use GCC compiler:
   >gcc -O3 -o clop.exe clop.c

But in win32, x86 you can see this: https://www.computerhope.com/issues/pictures/not-a-valid-win32-application.jpg

So to compile clop.c as win32 executable - just use "-m32" key:
   >gcc -m32 -O3 -o clop.exe clop.c

Also, I see this program have name a clop. "Клоп" in russian sounds disgustingly like a "bug", "crum".
But programming language of this is C.
So I think "cyclop" will be good name for this program...

   Cyclop multi-icon added.

To add icon when compiled - just follow this manual: https://fragglet.livejournal.com/4448.html
UPD2:
   This page on livejournal not opening correctly sometimes, so I'll write instructions here:
      1. Need to create .rc file with contents:
         'MAINICON ICON "cyclop.ico"'
         or
         '1 ICON "cyclop.ico"'
         (one string without right whitespaces and without left and right single quotes).
      2. Create .o file using windress. See -h, set -F. For win32 (x32) format must be pei-i38
         >windres -F pei-i38 6 cyclop.rc cyclop.o
      3. After creating .o file - just compile .c-file with .o file - using gcc:
         >gcc -m32 -O3 clop.c cyclop.o -o cyclop_win32.exe
      ____________________________________________________________________________
      for win64, linux, etc - maybe need to set another formats in windres.

P.S.: How to make multi-icon ico-file?
   1. Go here: https://username1565.github.io/MultiCoin-paperwallet/index_files/static/avatars/docs/index.html
   2. Upload picture, and create square avatar with size 256x256 pixels.
   3. Download avatar as image.
   4. Upload this here: https://convertico.com/ and download ico-file.
      This file is multiicon and contains 6 icons with resolutions: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256.
   5. You can check is this multiicon here: https://redketchup.io/icon/edit

   ciclop multi-icon updated.

	
How I did compile .c file with icon?
	In this case used next steps:
	1. Create avatar 256x256. Create icon. Create cyclop.rc

	2. Add this text there:
MAINICON ICON "cyclop.ico"

	3. Start "MinGW Command prompt" wint environment variables for compiler...

	4. create .o using windres:
	win32:	>windres -F pei-i386 cyclop.rc cyclop_win32.o
	win64:	>windres -F pe-x86-64 cyclop.rc cyclop_x64.o
	
	5. Compile .c with .o - using gcc:
	win32:	>gcc -m32 -O3 cyclop.c cyclop_win32.o -o cyclop_win32.exe
	win64:	>gcc -O3 cyclop.c cyclop_x64.o -o cyclop_x86-x64.exe

	And... SUCCESS! All files are here.
	
	Start.bat - added for win32 and win64 versions...

BEST REGARDS.
