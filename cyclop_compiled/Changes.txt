UPD1:
1. Multiple parts supporting - added. Filename changing according -n value. Added separate file to write first_and_last prime list.
2. More arguments - added. Run without arguments to see this.
3. Added system("pause"); to prevent closing window if double click on exe.
4. Check file function - added and this return structure for each part.
5. Added autocheck files if this contains primes.
6. Added separate writting, if some parts contains prime numbers.
7. Supporting the restoring separate damaged or deleted part, using previous command.
8. Code commented for understanding, test functions added and disabled.
9. Delimiters - added. You can set this by char code. See "usage info".
10. Multiicon ico-file - added. Compiled versions - added. Now this is Cyclop. C-CLOP.

UPD2:
Клоп ico and pictures - added.
Add silently/quietly 7z packing, without messages in console. (addition option "-y > nul" for each 7z command.)
Add dialog for set parameters if this was not specified in command line.
Add command line generator and display this, after dialog.
Add variables to check is argument specified or changed.
Add function to escape characters.
Add function to return escaped symbol.
Add function to unescape character.
Add second version of function for unescape (commened in code).
Add function to check is string a number or not.
Re-write function print-usage. Now default call for this is print_usage(0);
Add function to change fullpath to filename of exe in argv[0] when double click on exe in windows.
Add disabled argument for 7z to don't show dialog to enable this.
Add supporting to write and read primes, as binary data. (*, **)
	Write primes as 64-bit integers, without any delimieters. "-x64" option available - in command line.
	Write primes as prime gaps. "-gaps" option in command line.
	There is two formats for gaps:
	1. Two bytes for each full prime gap writted in file from unsigned short int.
		"-gaps2byte" option in command line. More compressing.
		In this case all primes can be writted as two bytes.
		[0000 - FFFF] = [0 - 65535] if very big range for gaps for all 64-bit prime numbers.
		prime gap writted fully.
	2. One bytes for each half prime gap writted in file from unsigned char (1 byte).
		"-gaps1byte" option in command line. The best compressing.
		In this case all primes can be writted as ONE BYTE.
			- All gaps are even number and can be divided by 2.
			- Many half gaps have the value lesser than 255, so can be writted as 1 byte.
			- 00 byte never used, because 0 gap cann't be exists. So 00 byte reserved for switch from 1 byte to 2 byte.
			- If 00 byte, then next two bytes are half prime gap as (unsigned short int - 2 bytes). All other prime gaps writted as 1 byte.
	Add gaps and 64-bit numbers - to check_file function.
	Now available checking this parts and append data if this not full.
	If primes not correct there will be delimiter block as text.
________________________________________________________________
*	I recommend to see the binary code of this files in hex-editor, in this case, this more readable.
	If many parts are generated and one from this sequence is deleted or incomplete,
	program can write fully or append data only to this part.
**	I thinking about writting the converter between lists, x64-binary data,
	and gaps (half-gaps) parts.	This converter may convert parts from each <-> to each.
